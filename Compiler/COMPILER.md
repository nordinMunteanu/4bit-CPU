# COMPILER

The precompiler takes a .2p4 2p4 Assembly file and converts it into a compilable file, then sends it thru TeraTerm to an ISP that will then translate it to machine code and send it to the CPU

Limitations: Currently written only for windows, for an ARDUINO UNO, connected in Serial to COM3. Will add Ubuntu support
